# Instagram Profile 
Recreating instagram profile using android architecture components ( Data Binding, Live Data, View Model )

## About This Project
In this project we will build an instagram profile using android architecture components
<B>( LiveData and ViewModel and Data Binding )</B> usning <B>MVVM</B> pattern by the help of
[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for consuming rest api data from [Instagram Api](https://www.instagram.com/developer/)

## Setting Up

Step-1 : Download this project on your local machine.

Step-2 : Get an access token from [Instagram Api](https://www.instagram.com/developer/)

        How to get an access token from instagram api
        
         1 : Register Your Application
         2 : Authentication

         https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT-URI&response_type=token
         For authentication use this url. It has three arguments

             First, client_id : you will get a client_id when you will register your application
             Second, redirect_uri : redirect_uri will be your redirect_uri when you register your application. It has to be same. I used 
             Third, response_type : response_type will be token

         3 : Once you has been authenticated and then authorized your application, Instagram redirects them to your redirect_uri with the access_token in the url fragment.
         It will look like this: http://your-redirect-uri#access_token=YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN

Step-3 : Put your access token inside Constants file under this project

Step-4: Run the application.
